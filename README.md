# App Inventor Video Labs

This repository contains **App Inventor (MIT App Inventor) companion projects** for my embedded & IoT tutorial videos.

Each demo is a **Lab** identified by a Case ID (e.g., `I0001`).  
Every lab includes:
- App Inventor project (`.aia`)
- Setup notes (MQTT / networking / device pairing)
- Optional screenshots of the UI
- Troubleshooting notes
